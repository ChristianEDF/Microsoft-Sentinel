# Microsoft-Sentinel
# SIEM using Microsoft Sentinel

## Objective
Welcome to my Microsft Sentinel project! As a beginner, I’ll be using Microsoft Sentinel, a cloud-native SIEM tool, through the Microsoft Learning platform and Azure tools. This project will teach me how to effectively monitor, detect, and respond to security threats. I’ll gain practical skills in security monitoring and incident response and I'll build confidende and effectiveness in manageing security operations.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Create and configure a Microsoft Sentinel Workplace.
- Display Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub solutions and data connectors.
- Configure Microsoft Sentinel Data Collection rules, NRT Analutic rule and Automation.
- Perform a simulated attack to validate Analytic and Automation rules.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) with microsoft sentinel.
- Azure Portal/ Azure Activity connector
- Microsoft Defender for CLoud
  
## Steps

First I created a Log Analytic workplace to deploy Microsoft Sentinel. To do so a subscription was needed but thanks to "pay as you go" and the free trial mode, I was able to get this project done.

Setting up the ressource group associated with the subscription plan to then create an Access control. As shown in the next picture

Next step after settting up the data retention is deploying the ressourcd.

I then configure Azure Activity log.

Next is setting up the automation rule.
#
In the next step, the goal was to perfom a simulated attack to confirm the rules previously configured. Due to technical issue, the page wouldn't load up complete. A ticket was put in to the technical support. I will still show the command that was run to attempt to achieve this goal.

We will now move to the incident report page and look at the interface available to detect, study and mitigate incidents

Since I ran into an issue it currently show no incidents being reported.

This concgludes this project in which in which I was able to grasp a fundamental understanding of Microsoft Sentinel to provide a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).
